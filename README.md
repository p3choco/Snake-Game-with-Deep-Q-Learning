# How It Works?



## Snake Perception and Decision-Making üêç
1. **Sensory Awareness**: The snake is programmed to perceive its immediate surroundings. It can detect obstacles within a one-block radius around its head.
2. **Directional Awareness**: The snake is aware of its current movement direction, which plays a crucial role in its decision-making process.
3. **Food Detection**: In addition to sensing its immediate surroundings, the snake is also aware of the direction in which food is located.

## Learning process
1. **Initial Snake Behavior**: Initially, the snake's movements are largely random.
2. **Game State Buffering**: As the game progresses, states from each game are stored in a buffer.
3. **Training Process**:
   - The buffer retains information like the current state, the next state, and the reward associated with each state.
   - Rewards for future states are adjusted using a discount factor.
   - The deep neural network aims to predict optimal moves for upcoming states.
   - Target values for training are derived using Bellman's equation.
   - Gradients are generated based on the difference between predicted and actual outcomes.
   - The model updates its weights according to these gradients.
4. **Reinforcement Learning Epochs**: Over numerous epochs, the snake increasingly relies on the deep network for decision-making.
5. **Model Preservation**: Once adequately trained, the model is saved for future use.

## Model Performance and Effectiveness
1. **Training Epochs**: The model reached its peak performance after approximately 600 training epochs.
2. **Average Score Achievement**: In its final form, the model consistently maintains an average score of around 30 points.
3. **Significance of the Score**: Considering the dimensions of the game board (20x20), achieving a 30-point score is a strong indicator of the model's effectiveness and strategic gameplay.
